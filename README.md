# DSDT-SSDT-Patches

Patches needed specially when running OS X or macOS, there are multiple branches of patches that you can choose at your own need! You can apply some of them directly to SSDT's & DSDT .dsl files decompiled properly (it's preferable), or others into the generated SSDT's .dsl for injecting DSM method device per device, or one SSDT that will contain all DSM methods needed.


## **Patches & Tweaks:**

There are some methods that you can add, devices, patches for renaming devices and some fixes, removing, replacing to let you emulate Mac machines.



## **Note:**

A Pre-Made patches for Mac Models, specially for who don't like to select patch by patch, an all-in-one with "compatible" to emulate an specific Mac Model machine version (xx,x) such as iMac, MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac Mini or MacPro, for sure this need time to be completed.

At the end of the build stage, an MaciASL Patch Source URL will be added.
