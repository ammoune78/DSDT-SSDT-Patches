# DSDT-SSDT-Patches
Patches needed when running OS X or macOS, there are multiple branches of patches that you can choose at your own need! You can apply some of them directly to SSDT's & DSDT .dsl files decompiled properly (it's preferable) or others in generated SSDT's .dsl for injecting DSM method into device per device, or one SSDT that will contain all DSM methods needed.

There are some methods that you can add, devices, patches for renaming devices and some fixes, removing, replacing to let you emulate Mac machines.
